# Utopia Vault Coder

## v1.1 (in development)
### Breaking Changes
- Renamed this module to **Utopia Vault Coder** - Also renamed code occurrences and removed **Metropolis** dependencies
  - Because of this, the **Tables** object implementation is left partially open.
- Updated accepted command line arguments:
  - The first argument specifies the path common for both input and output
  - The second argument specifies input file location relative to the common path
  - The third argument specifies the output file location relative to the common path
### New Features
- Added support for enumerations (see README for more details)
- Added support for deprecation (deprecation data type)
- Class name can be parsed from associated table name (if specified)
- Property name can now be guessed based on its data type (E.g. creation time properties are named "created" by default)
- Property documentation can be generated automatically for some data types
### Bugfixes
- Autogenerated table names used to be in wrong casing (first character in upper case under some circumstances)
### Other Changes
- Supports a wider range of key names in the input json document (e.g. "props" in addition to "properties")
- Supports latest **Flow** and **Vault** changes
- Supports abstract functions internally
