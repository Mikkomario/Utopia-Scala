# Utopia Firmament - List of Changes

## v1.0 (in development)
Initial version  
The following features were moved over from **Reflection**
- Generic component traits
- Generic container traits
- Stacking
- Component creation context classes (which were rewritten)
- Localization classes
- Icon support
- Custom drawing tools and traits
- Generic container implementation templates
- Container content management tools and traits
- Awt utilities

Basically everything that was not exclusive to **Reflection** was moved over to upper modules.  
This is in order to separate **Reach** from **Reflection**.
