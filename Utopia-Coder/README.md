# Utopia Coder
Utopia Coder module defines the common features used between multiple code-generating Utopia applications, 
namely **Utopia Vault Coder** and **Utopia Reach Coder**.

As this library is mostly intended for internal use at the moment, we will not describe it here in detail.  
In case you're interested in developing your own code-generating application based on this module, please 
contact me and I will add further information.
